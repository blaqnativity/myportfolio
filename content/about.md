# About Me

Hello there, I'm **Olukayode Asemudara**. I had my first degree in Sociology from Adekunle Ajasin University, Ondo State, Nigeria. I am a self-taught front-end developer.

## My Tech Journey

My tech journey started when I began working for a tech firm that built EMR solutions to reduce waiting time for patients seeking consultation. Initially, I was employed as a customer success officer, primarily responsible for onboarding new facilities and training their staff on how to effectively use our software. Gradually, I became fascinated with how the system worked. This fascination was the first spark that ignited my interest in exploring the possibilities of making tech my career.

Coupled with the well-known fact that tech professionals are making significant strides in the industry and earning good money, I found the exact motivation I needed to start. A friend gave me my first UI/UX YouTube tutorial to see if it was something I had an eye for. I replicated the design from the tutorial and continued to do so for every video I watched on YouTube. My curiosity and hunger for more complex tasks grew.

## Learning and Growth

I learned how to make websites with WordPress, Webflow, and Flutterflow (for mobile apps). When I exhausted the cyclical process of repetition and still felt unsatisfied, I finally purchased a Udemy course on front-end development and delved into the world of code.

So far, I've learned how to create amazing and responsive web apps using JavaScript and other frameworks like Vue.js and Nuxt 3.

## My Passion and Goals

I am very passionate about making this dream a reality and am open to interning opportunities and junior front-end development positions. I am eager to fully immerse myself in this new reality and make a significant impact. Additionally, I look forward to inspiring and guiding young individuals who are unsure about how to break into tech, just as I once struggled.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. If you have any opportunities or would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
